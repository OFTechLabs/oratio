# Oratio Use Case

I wanted to create a natural language interface for some of the applications I was working on which were highly specialized for the applications and not for anything else. Our users want to perform tasks very specific to our application, which do not have any value for other applications. This meant developing them had to be done by developers of our applications, yet there was no library to allow for this use case. Oratio solves that by allowing developers to create highly specialized natural language interfaces in their own application.

## Example application

The application has the ability to determine a strategy for financial portfolios and allows the user to determine, modify and compare the strategy to other potential strategies.

## Modify application data 

The user wants to modify the current strategy through natural language by updating certain parameters. Oratio allows for this because it runs within the application and can in fact run code written by the developers of the application. This code is highly application specific and can only be written by the developers of the application, which is exactly why Oratio is suited.

## Modify what data is shown on pages

The user wants to compare the current strategy to another strategy through natural language. In this case no data needs to be updated but the front-end needs to show different data. Again highly specialized application code needs to run to make these changes, which again is exactly what Oratio is suited for.

## General actions

The user wants to perform some simple (or complex) mathematics on some of the values shown by the application through natural language. This simply requires evaluation mathematics inputted by the user through natural language, hardly application specific, but again Oratio can be used for this. The Developers can write their own code for it or use the Math module already available.
